## LIVEBOT CAN BE USED FOR USER ACCOUNTS, HOWEVER IT IS AGAINST TOS TO DO SO. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
## USE FOR BOT ACCOUNTS IS NOT AGAINST TOS TO MY KNOWLEDGE
An app that allows you to be inside a bot!

At the moment, livebot is still in extreme beta. Installation instructions can be found below.

## What is this?
Livebot is a program built with electron and discord.js, that will allow you to have discord controlling a bot. You are able to view messages in channels, send messages, interact with people, and see what is going on in the servers your bot is in. Livebot will also work with a user account as well, so you are not just limited to bots.

Livebot had been built to copy discord, and while it is not exact, it is pretty close. More additions will come soon, so just be patient, but feel free to recommend any addition!

## How to install
### Manual (Necessary for Mac and Linux)
To install livebot, just download as a zip file, which you can do by pressing the green button above. Once you have downloaded and extracted the zip file, go into the directory with a command prompt or shell window. In the shell window, enter the command `npm install`. Make sure that the terminal window is running as administrator. Once this process is finished - it may take some time - type `npm test`. The livebot window will open and you're ready to go! Just paste your token in the bar at the top, press save, and that bot will be loaded into each time you open the app automatically!
### Easy (Windows Only)
If you would like to just download and open an exe file, switch to the `executable` branch, then just download that zip file. If you don't know how to switch, click the dropdown menu just above the file list, and to the left.

## Some features:
### Token switcher
This box is how you log into a profile. To log into a token by default, put it into this box then press the save button. Otherwise if you are just logging into a token just for a look, input the token into the box then press `enter`.<br>

### Barry!
Barry is the livebot version of discord's Clyde. Except Barry has some fun commands! Just use the prefix `/`. Only you can see what barry says, so don't worry about interfering with any conversations. <br>

### Profile card.
The profile card is able to tell you the username, the avatar image, the discriminator, and something discord does not have. The profile card will tell you if the account you are signed into is a bot or a user. This can be handy if you are not quite sure. <br>

### Guild card.
The guild card gives a little more information than the basic discord 'name of the guild'. The guild card shows you the name of the guild, the guild icon, and how many users are in the guild. <br>
